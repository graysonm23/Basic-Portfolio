        About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm a computer guy who loves all kinds of technology.
        I am studying part-time at SMU to be a Full-Stack Developer.
        When I am not learning, I am working full-time at Central Market.
        
        I love to discover new food flavors and new technologies.
        I am consistently looking for things to do.
        When I am at home I like to code and eat. It's pretty much my lifestyle.
        If I go out, it must consist of food of some sort.
        The main food groups for me is pizza, Asian-inspired dishes, and coffee.
